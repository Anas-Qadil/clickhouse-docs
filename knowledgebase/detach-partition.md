While ClickHouse Cloud does not allow detaching partitions, you can use this approach toÂ move a partition between the tables:

For example:
`ALTER TABLE db1.table1_partition_test MOVE PARTITION 'a' TO TABLE db1.table2_partition_test;`

Alternatively, you can copy the partition to the new table and drop the partition form the old table:
```
ALTER TABLE db1.table2_partition_test ATTACH PARTITION 'a' FROM db1.table1_partition_test;
ALTER TABLE db1.table1_partition_test DROP PARTITION 'a';
```
